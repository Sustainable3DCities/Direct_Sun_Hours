# Direct Sun Hours
The Grasshopper script-file included in this repository is used for computing the direct sun hours on windows and balcony doors of a set of buildings in a neighbourhood. Some of the buildings in the study area are represented in high level of detail (equivalent to [CityGML LOD4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300436?via%3Dihub)), while others are represented in a lower level of detail (equivalent to [CityGML LOD2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300436?via%3Dihub)). The goal is to examine how including or excluding obstructing gemmetries (e.g. balconies, balcony railings, etc.) of buildings represented in a high level of detail affect the results of daylight metric simulations such as the Sunlight Exposure (here expressed as direct sun hours).

<br>
<br>

## Direct Sunlight Exposure (definition):
Sunlight exposure is regulated by the Swedish Standard, which is based on the European Standard [EN 17037 - *Daylight in Buildings*](https://velcdn.azureedge.net/~/media/marketing/ee/professional/28mai2019%20seminar/veluxen17037tallinn28052019.pdf), and states that at minimum one room in an apartment has to receive at least 1.5 hours of direct sunlight on one day between February 1st and March 21st of a year.

<br>
<br>

## Input data:
- 3D city model including detailed building exterior information (equivalent to [CityGML LOD4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300436?via%3Dihub)) like e.g. windows, balconies, balcony railings, etc. 

<br>

The below figure depicts a example of a 3D city model that can be used as input. The windows of the *target buildings* for which we are going to compute the direct sun hours for, are highlighted in yellow.

The next figures give you the opportunity to get a closer look over the *target buildings*.

## Requirements:

- An installed version of [Rhino 7](https://www.rhino3d.com/) with the following tools:
  - [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)
  - [LadyBug](https://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug.html)


<br>
<br>

## Workflow:
The process depicted in this workflow computes the Direct Sun Hour values calculated for March 21st (0.5 min temporal resolution) over a grid of points (0.1m resolution) placed over every window in the target buildings (see figure in *Input data* section). . Finally, this implementation also takes into consideration how using different building facade materials and colours affects daylight access.

<br>

<ins><b>Step 1:</ins></b> Add the geometries (Geometry Pipeline) of the room (walls, ceiling, floor, windows, eaves) <br><br>
<ins><b>Step 2:</ins></b> Add the geometries (Geometry Pipeline) of the obstructions (e.g. ground, building facades of surrounding buildings, balconies of surrounding buildings, balcony railings of surrounding buildings) <br><br>
<ins><b>Step 3:</ins></b> Add a slider and a panel with the standard height value of a floor (2.79m). Include a multiplier to combine the slider and the floor height values to obtain the elevation coordinates (z-coord) of the different room-related geometries from floor to floor. <br><br>
<ins><b>Step 4:</ins></b> Add one Climate Studio *LightingMaterial* module per obstructing geometry to pick an appropriate material and colour with specific spectral properties. <br><br>
<ins><b>Step 5:</ins></b> Add one Climate Studio *LightingMaterial* module for every room-related geometry and pick an appropriate material and colour.<br><br>
<ins><b>Step 6:</ins></b> Add a Climate Studio *SceneLayer* module to construct a Scene Layer for daylight simulation, one for every geometry.<br><br>
<ins><b>Step 7:</ins></b> Add a sensor grid (using the Climate Studio *SensorGrid* module) with 0.2m resolution and placed 0.8m above a room floor surface.<br><br>
<ins><b>Step 8:</ins></b> Add a *Boolean Toggle* in combination with two *Cull Pattern* modules to control when balcony and balcony railing geometries are to be included as obstructions in the DF-computation and when not. <br><br>
<ins><b>Step 9:</ins></b> Add Climate Studio *DaylightModel* to prepare the scene for running the DF daylight simulation.<br><br>
<ins><b>Step 10:</ins></b> Add a Climate Studio *Daylight* module and select *Daylight Factor* as the chosen standard to run the corresponding daylight . <br><br>

## Output:
The computed Direct Sun Hours for every point in the grid is presented in the Rhino environment as a visual output while the corresponding values along with the grid-point coordinates the refer to are exported to 2 panels inside the Rhino Grasshopper environment. The panel contents can be exported to txt-files and imported to GIS environments for further processing.
